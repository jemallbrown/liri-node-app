What does this project do?
    This project is provided to address the requirments of Rutgers coding bootcamp, homework for week 10 (homework 10).
    The assignment required use of several node libraries as well as several different and distinct api.
    The node application "liri.js" can take in one of four commands:
        1. `concert-this`
            This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window;  Artist, Song name, preview link from Spotify and album the song is from.

        2. `spotify-this-song`
            This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window; 
            Name of the venue, location and date of event.

        3. `movie-this`
            This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window; Title, Year, IMDB Rating, Tomatoes Rating, Country of movie production, .Language, plot and actors.

        4. `do-what-it-says` - future implementation
            unable to add this to current SW


    I honestly wouldn't have thought I could do this just a few short weeks ago.  This homework assignment shows various node.js skills using  necessary to perform api calls, json parsing, data storage and use of multiple NMP packages.  Very good way to teach us how to use the skills provided during week 10 course work.
